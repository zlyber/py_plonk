A python version for zkGarage's [PLONK](https://github.com/ZK-Garage/plonk). The arithmetization was replaced by [fan-in-3 custom gates](https://github.com/ZK-Garage/plonk/pull/164).  
We provide a small-scale($$2^{10}$$) set of witness for test, or you can generate larger data yourself.  
To run the code, use: ```python3 main.py```
